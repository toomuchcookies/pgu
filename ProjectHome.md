PGU is a collection of useful modules for writing games with [PyGame](http://pygame.org). At the moment the project consists of:

  * Tools for editing tile-based levels
  * A module for creating GUIs
  * A set of general-purpose game libraries

PGU was originally developed by [Phil Hassey](http://www.philhassey.com/blog/) but is now being maintained by Peter Rogers.
