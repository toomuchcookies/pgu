# Introduction #

A long-needed page for posting tutorials, howtos and whatnot. There doesn't seem to be an easy way of letting other users edit the wiki without bringing them onto the project, unless I'm missing something. (though this is often the case)

So what probably makes sense is if people post their tutorials / suggetions as comments below, then I will move and merge them into this document here. (or a relevant subdocument, whatever makes sense)
